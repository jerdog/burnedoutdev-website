# BurnedOut.dev/rel
## Background
What started as a tweet from @emilyfreeman:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/oAFAwDxz8L">https://t.co/oAFAwDxz8L</a> is taken and I just hope whoever snagged it does something hilarious with it.</p>&mdash; Emily Freeman (@editingemily) <a href="https://twitter.com/editingemily/status/1102225946730422272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

kickstarted this idea... 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have <a href="https://t.co/xN5AyrE7ew">https://t.co/xN5AyrE7ew</a>... maybe some collaboration could happen</p>&mdash; Jeremy ðŸ¥‘ (@IAmJerdog) <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmJerdog/status/1102231605962248197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

Then a reply from @tbarn brought about this thought to gear it towards #DevRel and burnout:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hopefully including a page called <a href="https://t.co/yvQU4tWdlz">https://t.co/yvQU4tWdlz</a></p>&mdash; Taylor Barnett (@taylor_atx) <a href="https://twitter.com/taylor_atx/status/1102278796693159938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

## What now? 
Oh I have no clue. I do however think this is a good opportunity for the DevRel community to share their thoughts and such around DevRel burnout. Just not sure what ultimate form this is going to take at this time.  
Or, it was $15. What's the worst that could happen?
